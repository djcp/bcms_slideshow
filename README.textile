h1. bcms_slideshow

For now, it creates a slideshow of tagged images and uses the excellent "jQuery cycle":http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ plugin, exposing a few relevant options. Soon it'll allow you to create annotated slideshows that include arbitrary HTML as an overlay on the image.

h2. Installation

Use the normal module installation process "documented here.":http://guides.browsercms.org/installing_modules.html

h2. Requirements

"bcms_thumbnail":http://rubygems.org/gems/bcms_thumbnail >= 1.0.5, which in turn requires "mini_magick":http://http://rubygems.org/gems/mini_magick

You'll need to install bcms_thumbnail before using this module.

h2. Known issues

The jQuery that comes with the current stable browsercms is too old for the Cycle plugin. We include a newer jQuery (1.5), but it conflicts when the Visual Editor is turned on. This means the cycle plugin is essentially broken when the Visual Editor is turned on. If you turn off the Visual Editor, you'll be able to see your slideshow as it's meant to be.
